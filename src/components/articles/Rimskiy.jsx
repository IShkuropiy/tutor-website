                    Before you read the material below, listen to the music carefully and think about these questions:
                </p>
                <ul className="questions">
                    <li> What do you see in your imagination? A story? A scene? A picture?
                        There are no wrong answers — your ideas are perfect just as they are.</li>
                    <li>Do you notice any patterns or repeating parts in the music?</li>
                    <li>Can you hear a “main” theme — a melody that pops out and comes back again and again?</li>
                    <li>Can you sing it, hum it, play it on the piano, or even tap the rhythm with your foot?</li>
                    <li>What musical instruments can you hear? Which ones stand out the most?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov is often remembered as one of the great storytellers of Russian music. Before becoming a composer, he spent years as a naval officer and even sailed around the world. That experience stayed with him: few composers could paint the sea in sound the way he could. In his music you can feel everything — the gentle rise and fall of quiet waves, the vast breathing of an open ocean, and storms that erupt without warning.
                </p>

                <p>He wrote Scheherazade in 1888, inspired by the world of <span>One Thousand and One Nights</span>. This collection of Middle Eastern tales — shaped by Indian, Persian, and Arabic folklore — revolves around the stern Sultan Shahryar and his wise, quick-witted wife, Scheherazade.</p>

                <p>According to the legend, Shahryar, convinced that all women were unfaithful, vowed to marry and execute a new wife every day. Scheherazade saved herself with stories: each night she began a new tale but left it unfinished, forcing the Sultan to spare her until the next evening. Little by little, her storytelling softened his heart.</p>

                <p>The suite is built from four independent scenes, like four chapters from her endless book of tales: The Sea and Sinbad’s Ship, The Story of the Kalender Prince, The Young Prince and the Young Princess, Festival at Baghdad. The Sea. The Shipwreck</p>

                <h2>Prologue: The Sultan and Scheherazade</h2>
                <p>The music opens with a dark, heavy theme — the voice of Shahryar. Then, almost like a breath of air, the solo violin enters with a delicate, winding melody. This is Scheherazade herself, quietly beginning her first story.</p>
                <h2>I. The Sea and Sinbad’s Ship</h2>
                <p>The first movement paints an enormous, shimmering seascape. The lines flow broadly and calmly, as if the orchestra is rocking on gentle waves. We sense Sinbad’s ship gliding smoothly across the water. Slowly the sea begins to stir, the waves rise, and a powerful storm breaks open.</p>

                <h2>II. The Story of the Kalender Prince</h2>
                <p>The second movement feels like sitting down beside a wandering storyteller. It begins slowly and thoughtfully, then builds energy little by little. Rhythms become busier, colors brighter, and soon the music rushes forward with excited, bustling motion. Brass outbursts cut through like cries from a crowded marketplace.
                    This movement also includes a vivid battle scene — a transformed version of the Sultan’s earlier theme — and the dramatic flight of the giant Roc bird, heard in the brilliant, piercing high woodwinds.</p>

                <h2>III. The Young Prince and the Young Princess</h2>
                <p>Here the tone shifts completely. The music becomes gentle, lyrical, and graceful.
                    The Prince’s melody is smooth and elegant, like a dance.
                    The Princess’s theme echoes his but feels lighter and more animated, almost playful.
                    The two lines weave together into one of the most tender moments in the entire suite.</p>
                <h2>IV. Festival at Baghdad. The Sea. The Shipwreck</h2>
                <p>The finale begins with a lively celebration in Baghdad — bright colors, quick rhythms, and the joyful chaos of a crowded festival.
                    Suddenly the energy turns: the sea rises again in a furious storm. Waves crash in swirling harp runs and racing woodwinds. The battle theme returns, now more urgent and wild.
                    A massive brass chord, punctuated by the tam-tam, marks the moment the ship smashes against the rocks.</p>
                <p>Slowly the storm fades. The sea becomes still.
                    The violin returns one last time — Scheherazade finishing her tale with quiet, thoughtful beauty. The Sultan’s theme appears again, softened and transformed. And finally, the violin’s voice dissolves into the highest register, as though the storyteller is closing her book and whispering goodnight.</p>

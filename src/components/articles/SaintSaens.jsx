                <p><strong>“The Carnival of the Animals”</strong> (<span>Le Carnaval des animaux</span>) is a “grand zoological fantasy” by the French composer Camille Saint-Saëns (1886), written for orchestra and two pianos</p>

                </ul>
                <p>This humorous composition is made up of fourteen vivid and witty miniature movements. Saint-Saëns masterfully captures the character of each “animal”: from the pompous march of the Lion with its sweeping piano glissandos across the keyboard, to the clucking of Chickens in the overlapping lines of piano and violins; from the heavy, slow-moving double bass in “The Elephant” to the graceful bird-song interwoven with bright piano trills in “Aviary,” and the shimmering, flowing piano passages of the “Aquarium.”</p>


                <p>I would especially highlight movements No. 7 and No. 13. These are wonderfully beautiful, lyrical, and graceful melodies. More serious and almost poetic against the backdrop of the carnival’s humorous sketches, they are probably the most famous pieces in the entire cycle.</p>

                <p>If you don’t have time to listen to the whole “Carnival,” I highly recommend to listen: </p>
                <ul className="list">
                    <li><strong>No. 5 “The Elephant” </strong>
                        - a heavy, humorous dance of an elephant.</li>
                    <li><strong>No. 7 “Aquarium” </strong>
                        - a truly magical piece that sounds as if it's floating in water and glowing.</li>
                    <li><strong>No. 9 “Cuckoo in the Depths of the Woods” </strong> - calm and peaceful, like walking through a quiet forest. The piano plays gentle chords, and from far away you hear a single clarinet calling “cuckoo… cuckoo…” . </li>
                    <li><strong>No. 11 “Pianists” </strong>
                        a funny musical joke. Saint-Saëns imitates the sound of piano students practicing scales and exercises—over and over again. </li>
                    <li><strong>No. 14 “Finale” </strong>
                        Bright, lively, and energetic. All the animals return for a big parade. It sounds like pure joy.</li>
                </ul>
